Convert fixed-width files to csv files.

Call fw2csv with -h for help.

Requires python.


The first argument is expected to be a file which defines the field name and
end position for output value, e.g.:

foo   4
bar   8
herp  12
derp  20

Would specify a file where the first field "foo" is positions 1-4, "bar" is
5-8, etc.

After that, it takes 0 or more arguments of files to process. If not files or -
is given, standard in is read.

Examples:

cat /tmp/some_fixed_junk.txt | fw2csv /tmp/cuts.txt > /tmp/some_csv_junk.csv
fw2csv /tmp/cuts.txt /tmp/some_fixed_junk.txt > /tmp/some_csv_junk.csv
