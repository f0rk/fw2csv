Convert fixed-width files to csv files.

Call fw2csv with -h for help.

Requires python and the overpunch package if using data that is in the signed
overpunch format.


The first argument is expected to be a file which defines the field name and
end position for output value, e.g.:

foo   4
bar   8
herp  12
derp  20

Would specify a file where the first field "foo" is positions 1-4, "bar" is
5-8, etc.

Alternatively, the file may be a CSV file:
name,end,format
foo,4,X(10)
bar,8,
herp,12,
derp,s9(4)v9(4)

Excel files with the .xlsx extension are accepted as well and work the same way
as CSV files. openpyxl must be installed for this to work.

The general format for signed overpunch is s9(\d+)v9(\d+) and for implicit
decimal points is 9(\d+)v9(\d+). All other data is passed through as is.

After that, it takes 0 or more arguments of files to process. If not files or -
is given, standard in is read.

Examples:

cat /tmp/some_fixed_junk.txt | fw2csv /tmp/cuts.txt > /tmp/some_csv_junk.csv
fw2csv /tmp/cuts.txt /tmp/some_fixed_junk.txt > /tmp/some_csv_junk.csv
